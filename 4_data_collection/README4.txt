Data Collection for Media Management System

This project does not involve external data collection. All media entries are manually input by users through the user interface.

Reason for No Data Collection
- No external APIs, web scraping, or database imports were required for this project.
- Data is entered by the user directly in the form fields and saved temporarily in a local array (mediaList).

Notes
- If data collection features are added in the future (e.g., pulling information from online libraries or databases), appropriate scripts and documentation would be provided.
