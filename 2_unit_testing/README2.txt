Unit Testing for Media Management System

This folder contains the unit tests created to verify the functionality of individual components of the Media Collection Manager system, particularly JavaScript functions for adding, displaying, and deleting media.

How to Run Unit Tests
1. Open the unit_tests.html file in a web browser.
2. The tests will automatically run and display results on the page.
3. Review the test output to verify if all tests pass.

Requirements
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari)
- No additional frameworks or libraries required (no Jest, Mocha, etc.)

Notes
- Tests are written manually in basic JavaScript using console.assert() and simple output displays.
- These tests check functions independently without needing full UI interaction.
